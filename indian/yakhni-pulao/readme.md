Yakhni pulao
------------

Yakhni pulao is a very popular north Indian cuisine. This recipe is my wife's favorite Indian food, though much better if prepared by my mother in law who has tried her best to teach me to cook it too.

This yakhni pulao is based on a spice mix she uses, called "Shan Punjabi Yakhni Pilau".

Traditionally this dish uses goat meat, but you can substitute with lamb, preferrably mutton (but any decent lamb will work). I'm told shoulder is best, but any part is fine, I like to get a couple of different cuts. You should get 2 inch cubes of meat, some bone in (the bone in can be a little bigger, that's fine).

If cooked correctly, the rice should be sticky to the touch and the lamb should be soft and tender as you pull it from the bone. It really is one of the tastiest Indian dishes.

**Total time** 1.5 hours

**Active time** 40 minutes

**Serves** 6

Ingredients
-----------
- **1** Shan Punjabi Yakhni Pilau seasoning mix
- **2** White onions (finely cut 1 of them)
- **5lb** bone in goat meat in 2 inch cubes (see above for more info)
- **4** cloves garlic (2 of them grated on a microplane or crushed)
- **3** inchs ginger (grated on a microplane)
- **1** cup olive oil
- **3** cups of basmati rice, rinsed well

Directions
----------
Fill a dutch oven or large stock pot with 7 cups of water. Pour in Yakhni Pilau seasoning mix, goat pieces, 2 whole garlic and onion. Cook on a low boil for 30 to 45 minutes, until the lamb is tender.

Remove meat using a slotted spoon and set aside. Also remove onion and garlic and throw away. Pour the remaining liquid through a sieve into a kitchen bowl or container with measurements on it. There should be around 6 cups of water left. If there is less than 6 cups, add some water to make up for it. Set the stock water asside for later.

Into the empty pot, pour 1 cup of olive oil and bring almost to simmering under high heat. Turn heat to medium-high and add the chopped onion. Once the onion starts to turn light brown, after about 5 minutes, pour the oil through a sieve to remove the onion. Set the onion asside and pour the oil back into the pot, bring back up to heat.

Add grated ginger and garlic and cook for 2 minutes.

Add the cooked meat to the pot. Cook it for 5 minutes in the oil, stirring occasionally to brown all the sides.

Add back the onion and add the rice, followed by the reserved stock water. Bring to a boil and cover for 15 minutes or until the water has boiled off.

Serve along with raita (the raita can be made with a quarter cup of yoghurt, quarter cup water, 1tsp cumin and a pinch of salt, just put it in a cup and whisk it with a fork).
