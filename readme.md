My collection of recipes. Feel free to contribute, just copy paste one of the recipe folders and roughly follow the same format if you'd like to merge back in. I'm planning to turn these open source recipes into a website one day, they deserve to be shared!

My recipes are inspired by J. Kenji LÃ³pez-Alt, a wonderful chef and food blogger who wrote Food Lab and has some great recipes on [Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/editors/j-kenji-lopez-alt). Also his youtube channel is awesome. My other inspiration is Ishrat Jafri, my mother in law, who is an absolutely kick-ass cook and my number one favorite chef.

### [Yakhni pulao](indian/yakhni-pulao)
Yakhni pulao is a very popular north Indian dish. This recipe is my wife's favorite Indian food, though much better if prepared by my mother in law who has tried her best to teach me to cook it too.
